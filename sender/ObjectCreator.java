/*
1) A simple object with only primitives for instance variables. The user of your program must also be
able to set the values for these fields.
2) An object that contains references to other objects. Of course, these other objects must also be
created at the same time, and their primitive instance variables must be settable by the user. Your
program must also be able to deal with circular references (i.e. objects connected in a graph).
3) An object that contains an array of primitives. Allow the user to set the values for the array
elements to arbitrary values.
4) An object that contains an array of object references. The other objects must also be created at the
same time.
5) An object that uses an instance of one of Javaâ€™s collection classes to refer to several other objects.
These objects, too, must be created at the same time.
